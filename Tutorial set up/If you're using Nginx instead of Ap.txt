If you're using Nginx instead of Apache, the process to install and configure phpPgAdmin will be slightly different. Here's a guide tailored for setting up phpPgAdmin with Nginx:

1. **Connect to Your VPS**:
   Use SSH to connect to your VPS using the terminal:
   
   ```bash
   ssh your_username@your_server_ip
   ```

2. **Install phpPgAdmin**:
   Install phpPgAdmin using the package manager available on your system. For example, if you're using Ubuntu, you can use `apt`:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install phppgadmin
   ```

3. **Configure Nginx**:
   Create a new Nginx server block (virtual host) configuration file for phpPgAdmin. Replace `your_domain` with your actual domain name or IP address:
   
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/phppgadmin
   ```

   Add the following configuration:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your_domain;

       location /phppgadmin {
           root /usr/share/phppgadmin;
           index index.php;
       }

       location ~ ^/phppgadmin/(.*\.php)$ {
           root /usr/share;
           fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;  # Adjust PHP version if needed
           fastcgi_index index.php;
           include fastcgi_params;
           fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
       }
   }
   ```

   Save and exit the editor.

4. **Enable the Nginx Configuration**:
   Create a symbolic link to enable the Nginx configuration you just created:
   
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/phppgadmin /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

5. **Configure phpPgAdmin**:
   Edit the phpPgAdmin configuration file to specify the PostgreSQL server details, just like in the previous responses:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/phppgadmin/config.inc.php
   ```
$conf['servers'][0]['host'] = 'your_postgresql_server_ip';
$conf['servers'][0]['port'] = 5432;  // Default PostgreSQL port
$conf['servers'][0]['sslmode'] = 'allow';  // Use 'disable' for non-SSL connections
$conf['servers'][0]['defaultdb'] = 'your_default_database';
$conf['servers'][0]['pg_dump_path'] = '/usr/bin/pg_dump';  // Path to pg_dump binary

6. **Restart Nginx and PHP-FPM**:
   Restart Nginx and PHP-FPM to apply the changes:
   
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   sudo systemctl restart php7.4-fpm  # Adjust PHP version if needed
   ```

7. **Access phpPgAdmin**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://your_domain/phppgadmin`. You should see the phpPgAdmin login page. Log in with your PostgreSQL username and password.

As with any setup, ensure that your server's security is properly configured, including firewall rules and SSL certificates if your server is publicly accessible. Also, remember to consult the documentation and best practices for Nginx, phpPgAdmin, and your specific environment.


It seems that PHP-FPM with version 7.4 might not be installed on your system or might be using a different service name. You can try the following steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Installed PHP Versions**:
   Confirm the installed PHP versions on your system using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo update-alternatives --display php
   ```

   This will show a list of available PHP versions on your system. Look for the version number you're using and note the service name associated with it.

2. **Start PHP-FPM Service**:
   If you know the correct service name for your PHP version, try starting the PHP-FPM service. For example, if you're using PHP 7.4, the service name might be `php7.4-fpm`. If you're using PHP 8.0, it might be `php8.0-fpm`.

   To start the service, use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start php7.4-fpm  # Replace with your PHP version
   ```

3. **Install Missing PHP-FPM**:
   If you find that the PHP-FPM service is missing for the version you need, you might need to install it. The exact package name could vary depending on your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install PHP-FPM for PHP 7.4 with:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install php7.4-fpm
   ```

   Replace `php7.4-fpm` with the appropriate package name for your PHP version.

4. **Restart Nginx**:
   After making changes related to PHP-FPM, don't forget to restart Nginx to ensure the changes take effect:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

Remember, the steps might slightly differ based on your system's setup and the package management system you're using. Always consult the documentation for your specific Linux distribution and PHP version to ensure accurate information.
