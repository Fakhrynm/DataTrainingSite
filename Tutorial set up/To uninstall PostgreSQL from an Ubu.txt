To uninstall PostgreSQL from an Ubuntu system, you can follow these steps:

1. **Stop PostgreSQL:**

   Before uninstalling, it's a good idea to stop the PostgreSQL service. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop postgresql
   ```

2. **Uninstall PostgreSQL:**

   You can use the `apt` package manager to uninstall PostgreSQL along with its related packages:

   ```bash
   sudo apt remove --purge postgresql postgresql-contrib
   ```

   The `--purge` option removes not only the packages but also their configuration files.

3. **Remove Data Directory (Optional):**

   The uninstall process above does not remove the PostgreSQL data directory, which may contain your databases. If you're sure you don't need the data, you can delete the PostgreSQL data directory with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -r /var/lib/postgresql/
   ```

   Be very cautious with this step, as it will irreversibly delete your databases.

4. **Remove Configuration Files (Optional):**

   If you want to remove configuration files as well, you can run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt purge postgresql postgresql-contrib
   ```

5. **Clean Up:**

   After the uninstallation, it's a good practice to clean up any residual dependencies or packages that are no longer needed:

   ```bash
   sudo apt autoremove
   ```

Remember that uninstalling PostgreSQL will permanently delete any data stored in the PostgreSQL data directory. Make sure you have a backup of any important data before proceeding.

Please note that the exact commands and steps might vary depending on the version of Ubuntu you are using. Always double-check the commands and their effects before proceeding.
